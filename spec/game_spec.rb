# The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:
# There are two players in the game (X and O)
# Players take turns until the game is over
# A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
# A turn ends when a player claims a field
# A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
# A game is over if a player wins
# A game is over when all fields are taken
# Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe.
# It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe 
# by combining your code with any user interface,
# whether web or command line.

# Acceptance Criteria:
#   Allows Players to switch Turns
#   Checks if a player has won
#   Checks if Board is full
#   Checks if a player has Won:
#     Checks Diagonals
#     Checks Horizontals
#     Checks Verticals
